Federico is a PhD candidate at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella and Universidad de Buenos Aires. His current research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of affective polarization and political segregation. By performing behavioral experiments and computational models he is trying to understand the role of political extremes in the increasingly polarization.

In his BSc thesis, Federico performed a gamified mobile experiment to study the performance of participants doing mental arithmetic operations. By developing a mobile app, he was able to gather longitudinal data in a fast, cheap, and scalable way. He has presented this projectâ€™s results at TEDx.

Federico is also a part-time lecturer at Universidad Torcuato 
ella.
