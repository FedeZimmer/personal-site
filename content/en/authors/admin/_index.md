I am a PhD candidate at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella and Universidad de Buenos Aires. My current research focuses on the psychological underpinnings of affective polarization and political segregation. By performing behavioral experiments and computational models I am trying to understand the role of political extremes in the increasing polarization.

In my BSc thesis, I performed a gamified mobile experiment to study participants’ performance on mental arithmetic operations. By developing a mobile app, I was able to gather longitudinal data in a fast, cheap, and scalable way. I have presented this project’s results at TEDx.

I am a part-time lecturer at Universidad Torcuato Di Tella.
