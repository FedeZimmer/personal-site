I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Digital Emotions Lab within the Digital, Data, and Design Institute at Harvard Business School.

I am a computational social scientist who is interested in the psychological processes associated with social interactions. During my doctoral studies at the Universidad de Buenos Aires in Argentina, I conducted research using a combination of experimental and computational methods to investigate the underlying psychological mechanisms behind affective polarization and political segregation.
